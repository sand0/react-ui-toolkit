      <p>Hey there, welcome to my UI component library documentation.</p>
      <p>
        This project is currently my playground to learn and practice new
        things, while also working towards my vision of creating a library that
        can be easily integrated into your development stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you browse through the library, you'll see that I've included a
        couple of UI components that are available to use, but I'm always
        looking to improve and add new components, features, and optimizations
        as time allows.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'm able to build this library to a minimum viable product (MVP)
        scale, I'm considering publishing it to the NPM registry. This will make
        it easy for other developers, and for myself, to install and use the
        library in different projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would appreciate any feedback and suggestions as I continue to work on
        this project. Together, we can create something truly valuable for the
        community of developers and designers.
      </p>
      <p>Thanks for checking out my library, and happy coding!</p>
